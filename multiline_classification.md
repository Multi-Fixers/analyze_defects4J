# Logic for Classifying Bugs

## Hunk Count
- Each section starting with `@@` represents a hunk. You will want to count these occurrences to determine the total number of hunks.

## Counting Buggy Lines
1. **Continuous Additions (+)**: 
   - Count only one repair location for continuous additions.
  
2. **Normal Line Followed by Addition (+)**: 
   - If a normal line is followed by an addition, count them separately as distinct locations.
  
3. **Replacement (- followed immediately by +)**: 
   - Counting this as a single location is valid, as it represents a change in the same line.
  
4. **Closing Bracket Addition**: 
   - If the line only contains `}`, it should not be counted, as it does not represent a logical bug fix.

## Potential Issues in the Logic
- **Context Awareness**: 
  - Ensure the logic handles cases where lines may have context or impact on adjacent lines. For example, if lines are only closing a block but should have contained logic.
  
- **Mixed Content**: 
  - If a single hunk has a mix of changes, such as deletions and additions that don't directly relate, make sure the logic appropriately accounts for these distinctions.
